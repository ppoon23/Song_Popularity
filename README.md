# Spotify-Project

## Overview

My name is Patrick Poon from University of San Francisco. The goal of this project is to utilize Sci-kit learn machine learning library to predict the popularity of a song from 2010 - 2020. The motivation is that if we can predict how popular a song is based on audio features (such as tempo, song acousticness, instrumentalness), then the song can be correlated to ranks in the Billboard Top 100 chart.
